				<h3>15<sup>th</sup> June, 2021</h3>
				<p>So, I was reading about decentralized apps with a peer-to-peer protocol and while searching deep inside Dapps and P2PP, it struck in my mind, "How can we manage to control the type of protocol we use in our web apps?", so I searched about it and deci...</p>

				<p>Hey there, I am using hashnode. And this time it is about MVC architectural design pattern. I saw a lot of videos and pages to understand what is model view controller or MVC as I was not satisfied with just a single source so I will try my best that...</p>

				<h3>30<sup>th</sup> January, 2021</h3>
				<p>So, I was reading this post on Twitter where a coder asked the community, "what will you do if your internet is shut down for a week?" A lot of people replied that they would go on a trip or read a book or follow their hobbies. And I thought of answering that question too but couldn't think of something interesting cause I have nothing...</p>

				<p>Do these questions come to your mind like should I create a blog or not? Is it necessary? I don't have much content to write a blog, how will I be able to increase the length from a sentence to a paragraph? Give this blog a shot and don't wait, just take a bath, start thinking of a topic, and start writing about it. Don't worry about...</p>

				<h3>22<sup>th</sup> November, 2020</h3>

The license is what turns code into an open source component.</p>
