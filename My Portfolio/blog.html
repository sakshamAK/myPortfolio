			<h3>15<sup>th</sup> Jan, 2022</h3>
			<p>We all know that JS is a single-threaded non-blocking asynchronous concurrent language. But what does
				this actually mean? Letâ€™s find out: Suppose we have a function that calls another function that calls
				one more function, such as: function add(a,b) <a

			<h3>15<sup>th</sup> June, 2021</h3>
			<p>So, I was reading about decentralized apps with a peer-to-peer protocol and while searching deep inside

			<p>Hey there, I am using hashnode. And this time it is about MVC architectural design pattern. I saw a lot

			<p>Okay so as being a react developer that has always focused on coding while not giving much preference to
				the theory part, I decided to learn some stuff which led me here to Architectural Patterns, so I decided

			<h3>30<sup>th</sup> January, 2021</h3>
			<p>So, I was reading this post on Twitter where a coder asked the community, "what will you do if your

				or follow their hobbies. And I thought of answering that question too but couldn't think of something
